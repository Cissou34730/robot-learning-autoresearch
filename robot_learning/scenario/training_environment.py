"""Training-only environment construction for the baseline recipe.

Only the target distribution the policy trains on lives here. Task mechanics,
success semantics and evaluation behavior stay in
`robot_learning/scenario/environment.py`. Changing this module changes what the
policy learns but never how an already-saved policy is measured, so it is
excluded from the research-evaluation semantics fingerprint.
